# Olympic Games Dashboard


## About project
Few-paged dashboard which shows some statistics for countries but also copetitors during Olympic Games. User can choose from slicers which sort data by medal,year, season, country
or sport. Data comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fearsomejockey/olympics-dataset-2020-tokyo-dataset). I used some DAX formulas to merge country names
from original dataset into one column, create some measuers and one more table which is responsible for storing medal and its id.
